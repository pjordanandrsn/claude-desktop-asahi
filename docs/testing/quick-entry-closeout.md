# Quick Entry — Upstream Contract + Test Index

Reference doc for the Quick Entry surface. Two halves:

- [§ Upstream design intent](#upstream-design-intent) documents what upstream Quick Entry promises vs. doesn't, with code anchors into `build-reference/app-extracted/.vite/build/index.js`. Treat as the authoritative answer when triaging whether a Quick Entry behavior is a Linux compat regression (our problem) or upstream-by-design (not our problem).
- [§ Test list](#test-list) enumerates the QE-N items as conceptual checks and maps each to the concrete S-N / T-N case that backs it. Spec headnotes (S09, S12, S31, S37) cite specific QE-N IDs by anchor; [§ Scaffold integration](#scaffold-integration) is the authoritative QE-N → S-N table.

The QE-N items originated in the close-out sweep for [#393](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/393), [#404](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/404), and [#370](https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian/issues/370). The sweep has run; what remains is the upstream-contract reference + the test-index mapping.

## Upstream design intent

Read this before reading the test list. Several `QE-*` rows test things upstream does not actually promise — those tests are still valuable as black-box behavior checks, but the calibration of "expected" matters.

Source for everything below: `build-reference/app-extracted/.vite/build/index.js`. Symbol names (`h1`, `ut`, `Ko`, `ynt`, `nde`, `g3A`, `u7A`) drift between releases — anchor on shape, not name.

### What upstream promises

- **Global shortcut** registered via Electron `globalShortcut.register()` (`:499416`). No app-focus gate — fires regardless of which app is focused.
- **Popup is lazily created** on first shortcut press (`if (!Ko || ...) Ko = new BrowserWindow(...)` near `:515375`). The popup `BrowserWindow` is constructed on demand, not at app startup. This is what makes QE-4 (closed-to-tray) work.
- **Position memory:** popup position persists across invocations via `an.get("quickWindowPosition")` (`:515491-515526`), keyed on monitor label + resolution. If the original monitor is gone, falls back to primary display.
- **Submit always creates a NEW chat session** when no `chatId` is provided (`ynt(e)` at `:515546`). Quick Entry never appends to an existing conversation.
- **Click-outside dismiss** is wired in the main process via the popup `blur` handler (`Ko.on("blur", () => g3A(null))` at `:515465`).
- **Popup survives main-window close.** If the user closes the main window via the X button (not full quit), `!ut || ut.isDestroyed()` guards at `:515595` skip the `show()/focus()` calls; the popup itself remains functional.
- **Window construction** sets `transparent: true`, `backgroundColor: "#00000000"`, `frame: false`, `alwaysOnTop: true` (level `"pop-up-menu"`), `skipTaskbar: true`, `resizable: false`, `show: false` (`:515375-515397`). `hasShadow: Zr` and `type: Zr ? "panel" : void 0` are macOS-only (`Zr === process.platform === "darwin"`).

### What upstream does NOT promise

- **Workspace migration.** No `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces()`, no `moveTop()`, no `setWorkspace()` is called anywhere in the Quick Entry submit path. Whether the main window comes to the user's current workspace or stays on its own is purely a compositor decision driven by `mainWin.show()` + `mainWin.focus()`. **Linux/Wayland behavior here is not part of the upstream feature spec.**
- **Restore from minimized.** No `restore()` call in the submit path. `show()` un-minimizes on most WMs; whether it does on a given Wayland compositor is up to that compositor.
- **Multi-monitor placement on cursor / focused display.** Upstream uses last-saved position or primary display, never "where the user is right now."
- **Multi-window targeting.** All `show`/`focus` calls go through `ut` (the main window). If the user has multiple windows, behavior is undefined.
- **Popup re-creation if its `BrowserWindow` is destroyed.** Upstream does not re-construct `Ko` after destroy — it's only created on first shortcut press.
- **Compositor-aware behavior.** Upstream has no concept of "GNOME vs KDE vs wlroots." Anywhere our patches branch on `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`, that's our project compensating for compositor-specific Electron breakage, not implementing an upstream-defined contract.

### Edge case: fullscreen main window

`:525287-525290` reads (paraphrased): *"if `ut` exists and `ut.isFullScreen()` is true, focus `ut` and call `ide()`; else show the Quick Entry popup."* So if the main window is fullscreen when the shortcut fires, **the popup does not appear** — the shortcut focuses the main window instead. QE-1 needs this caveat.

### Edge case: `h1()` is a *don't-show-if-already-focused* optimization

The visibility-check function (`h1()` at `:105164-105171`) is upstream's mechanism for "don't redundantly call `show()` if the main window is already focused." Sound design. The reason it's broken on Linux is Electron's `BrowserWindow.isFocused()` returning stale-true after `hide()` on Linux backends — i.e., **the patch we apply is fixing a Linux-Electron bug, not diverging from upstream intent.** Once `isFocused()` returns honest values on Linux, the patch could be retired.

## Test list

Each item is a single check. Severity tier matches the existing scaffolding (Critical / Should / Smoke). Existing test ID in parentheses — `(new)` means this item should be added to [`cases/shortcuts-and-input.md`](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md) before this sweep is reproducible by anyone else.

### Shortcut activation — covers #404

| ID | Severity | Step | Expected | Existing |
|----|----------|------|----------|----------|
| QE-1 | Smoke | App focused (not fullscreen), press shortcut | Popup appears. **Edge case from upstream design:** if main window is fullscreen, the shortcut focuses main and runs `ide()` instead of showing the popup (`:525287-525290`). Test this fullscreen variant separately as QE-1b — popup should *not* appear. | [S34](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s34--quick-entry-shortcut-focuses-fullscreen-main-window-instead-of-showing-popup) (QE-1b only) |
| QE-2 | Critical | Other app focused, press shortcut | Popup appears | [T06](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#t06--quick-entry-global-shortcut-unfocused), [S11](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s11--quick-entry-shortcut-fires-from-any-focus-on-wayland-mutter-xwayland-key-grab) |
| QE-3 | Critical | App on a different workspace, press shortcut | Popup appears on current workspace | [T06](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#t06--quick-entry-global-shortcut-unfocused) |
| QE-4 | Critical | App closed-to-tray (no window mapped), press shortcut | Popup appears | [S29](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s29--quick-entry-popup-is-created-lazily-on-first-shortcut-press-closed-to-tray-sanity) |
| QE-5 | Should | App quit entirely, press shortcut | No popup, no error, no zombie process | [S30](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s30--quick-entry-shortcut-becomes-a-no-op-after-full-app-exit) |
| QE-6 | Should | Inspect Electron argv via `cat /proc/$(pgrep -f 'app\.asar')/cmdline \| tr '\0' ' '` (the launcher script also matches `claude-desktop`, so anchor on `app.asar` to hit the Electron process). Cross-check launcher log line `Using X11 backend via XWayland (for global hotkey support)` (the GNOME default) vs `Using native Wayland backend (global shortcuts via XDG portal)` (after `CLAUDE_USE_WAYLAND=1`). | **Launcher implemented (S12).** GNOME defaults to XWayland (no portal flag); launching with `CLAUDE_USE_WAYLAND=1` adds `--ozone-platform=wayland` and a single `--enable-features=…,GlobalShortcutsPortal` (comma-joined with the ozone features, not a standalone token). On that opt-in path QE-2 / QE-3 pass on **GNOME ≤ 49** after the one-time portal dialog; on **GNOME 50 / xdg-desktop-portal ≥ 1.20** they don't yet — Electron skips the portal's `Registry.Register` handshake ([electron#51875](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/51875)). | [S12](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s12----enable-featuresglobalshortcutsportal-launcher-flag-wired-up-for-gnome-wayland) |

### Submit → main window — covers #393

| ID | Severity | Step | Expected | Existing |
|----|----------|------|----------|----------|
| QE-7 | Smoke | Main window visible, submit prompt from QE | Popup closes; main window navigates to a **new** chat session (not appended to current chat — `ynt(e)` at `:515546` always creates new). | [S31](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s31--quick-entry-submit-makes-the-new-chat-reachable-from-any-main-window-state) |
| QE-8 | Critical | Main window minimized, submit | **Upstream calls `show() + focus()` only — no `restore()`.** Whether the WM un-minimizes is compositor-dependent. Test as black-box: record whether the new chat is reachable to the user (window comes back to view, OR user has to click tray/dock to see it). Both outcomes are upstream-acceptable; only "new chat created but unreachable" is a regression. | [S31](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s31--quick-entry-submit-makes-the-new-chat-reachable-from-any-main-window-state) |
| QE-9 | Critical | Main window hidden-to-tray (after [T08](./cases/tray-and-window-chrome.md#t08--hide-to-tray-on-close)), submit | Same as QE-8 — `show()` should re-map a hidden window on most compositors, but upstream doesn't guarantee it. The new chat must be reachable; the path to reach it (auto vs tray-click) is compositor-dependent. | [S31](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s31--quick-entry-submit-makes-the-new-chat-reachable-from-any-main-window-state) |
| QE-10 | Should | Main window on different workspace, submit | **Upstream has no workspace logic** (no `setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces`, no `moveTop`). Outcome is whatever the compositor decides on `show()` + `focus()`. Record observed behavior per row; do not treat any single outcome as the "right" one. | [S31](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s31--quick-entry-submit-makes-the-new-chat-reachable-from-any-main-window-state) |
| QE-11 | Critical | **GNOME-specific (Andrej730 repro):** App in tray, *not* present in Dash/dock, submit | Main window opens. The codebase doesn't reason about Dash presence — this is purely a compositor-observed state. The underlying failure is `BrowserWindow.isFocused()` returning stale-true on GNOME mutter, which causes the patched (KDE) code path's `h1() || ut.show()` chain to short-circuit before `show()`. Test as a black-box repro. | [S32](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s32--quick-entry-submit-on-gnome-mutter-doesnt-trip-electron-stale-isfocused) |
| QE-12 | Should | App in tray, *also* present in Dash/dock, submit | Main window opens (this state should not trip the stale-focus bug, but verify) | [S32](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s32--quick-entry-submit-on-gnome-mutter-doesnt-trip-electron-stale-isfocused) |
| QE-13 | Smoke | Submit prompt with 1-2 chars (`hi`) | Upstream silently drops. The actual gate is `> 2` chars at `index.js:515530, 515533` — anything 3+ submits. So `hi` (2) drops, `hel` (3) submits. Document, do not fix. | — |

### Visual / window appearance — covers #370

| ID | Severity | Step | Expected | Existing |
|----|----------|------|----------|----------|
| QE-14 | Should | Inspect popup background | Transparent; no opaque square frame visible behind the rounded UI. **Note:** upstream already sets `transparent: true` and `backgroundColor: "#00000000"` (`:515380, :515383`), so the #370 triage-bot suggestion to "try setting backgroundColor to transparent" is moot — those are already in place. The Electron 41.0.4 regression is at the CSD/shadow rendering layer below those flags, not at the option-passing layer. | [S10](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s10--quick-entry-popup-is-transparent-no-opaque-square-frame) |
| QE-15 | Smoke | Inspect popup chrome | No titlebar, no close/min/max buttons (frameless) | — |
| QE-16 | Smoke | Inspect popup edges | Drop shadow + rounded corners render (compositor-dependent — note where missing) | — |
| QE-17 | Smoke | Open popup, then click on another window | Popup stays above (always-on-top) | — |
| QE-18 | Should | `electron --version` against the running app's bundled binary; record version in matrix | When > 41.0.4 ships and #370 still reproduces, the upstream-regression hypothesis is wrong | [S33](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s33--quick-entry-transparent-rendering-tracked-against-bundled-electron-version) |

### Patch-application sanity — regression prevention

| ID | Severity | Step | Expected | Existing |
|----|----------|------|----------|----------|
| QE-19 | Critical | **All rows.** Extract the installed `app.asar` (`npx asar extract /usr/lib/claude-desktop/app.asar /tmp/inspect-installed`) and grep the bundled JS for the KDE gate string injected by the patch: `grep -c 'XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP' /tmp/inspect-installed/.vite/build/index.js`. The patch (`scripts/patches/quick-window.sh:34-35, 117-118`) injects `(process.env.XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP\|\|"").toLowerCase().includes("kde")` — that string is the runtime fingerprint. Note: the `Patched quick window` / `WARNING: No quick entry show() calls patched` lines from the patch are **build-time stdout** (not in `launcher.log`); check the build log if you built locally. | Bundled JS contains the KDE gate string (patch ran at build time). The patch ships in every build; the KDE-vs-non-KDE branch is decided at runtime by the env-var check. **Runtime gate effectiveness is verified implicitly by QE-7 through QE-12 passing on KDE and the unpatched-equivalent path running on non-KDE.** | [S09](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s09--quick-window-patch-runs-only-on-kde-post-406-gate) |

### Input behavior smoke — catches collateral breakage

| ID | Severity | Step | Expected | Existing |
|----|----------|------|----------|----------|
| QE-21 | Smoke | In popup: `Esc` dismisses; click-outside dismisses; `Shift+Enter` inserts newline; `Enter` submits | All four behave as labelled. **Implementation notes for diagnostics:** click-outside is wired in the **main process** via the popup's `blur` handler (`:515465`). `Esc` / `Enter` / `Shift+Enter` are **renderer-side** (not visible in `index.js`); they go through IPC to `requestDismiss()` (`:515409`) and `requestDismissWithPayload()`. If a dismiss key fails, isolate which side is broken before reporting. | — |

### Popup placement & lifecycle — upstream contract sanity

These verify upstream-promised behaviors that aren't directly broken by #393/#404/#370 but live in the same surface area. Failures here would indicate a separate regression — file a new issue rather than folding it into the close-out trio.

| ID | Severity | Step | Expected | Existing |
|----|----------|------|----------|----------|
| QE-22 | Should | Invoke Quick Entry. Note popup position. Dismiss (Esc). Quit Claude Desktop entirely (`pkill -f app.asar` after closing the main window, or via tray → Quit). Re-launch. Invoke Quick Entry. | Popup reappears at the same monitor + position as before the restart. Upstream persists position via `an.get("quickWindowPosition")` (`:515491-515526`), keyed on monitor label + resolution. Position must survive a full app restart, not just dismiss/re-invoke. | [S35](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s35--quick-entry-popup-position-is-persisted-across-invocations-and-across-app-restarts) |
| QE-23 | Smoke | **Multi-monitor required.** With an external monitor connected, invoke Quick Entry on the external monitor — let the position be saved (trigger QE-22's persistence path). Disconnect the external monitor (libvirt: `virsh detach-device` for the second display, or unplug the host monitor passing through). Invoke Quick Entry. | Popup falls back to the primary display via `cHn()` (`:515502`). Does **not** appear at off-screen coordinates. Skip this row in single-monitor VMs. | [S36](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s36--quick-entry-popup-falls-back-to-primary-display-when-saved-monitor-is-gone) |
| QE-24 | Should | Launch app, focus main window, then **destroy** the main window without quitting the app. On this project the X button hide-to-tray override means the standard close path won't destroy `ut`; force the destroy via a) DevTools console (`Cmd+Opt+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I` → `require('electron').remote.getCurrentWindow().destroy()` if exposed), or b) accept that this case is unreachable on Linux without a code change and skip. After destroy, invoke Quick Entry, type, submit. | Popup remains functional (lazy-recreation on shortcut press; the `!ut \|\| ut.isDestroyed()` guard at `:515595` skips the show/focus block but does not crash). New chat creation may not have a window to surface in — if app remains running with no main window, this is the "popup outlives main" path upstream guarantees. **If unreachable on Linux, mark this row N/A and document why.** | [S37](./cases/shortcuts-and-input.md#s37--quick-entry-popup-remains-functional-after-main-window-destroy) |
